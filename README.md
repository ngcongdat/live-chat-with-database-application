# Live Chat Application!

Hi! I'm Dat. This is a very simple Client/Server Chat Application using `TCP Sockets Java` and using `SQL Server` to save all data to database.

## How to Works

 - **Step 1:** Create Database by file SQL attached.
 - **Step 2:** Run the server before the client, because the server keeps waiting for the client to be connected.
 - **Step 3:** Run the client.
 - **Step 4:** Input host IP, port and username. Then click Connect.
 - **Step 5:** In Server Box frame, you can see all users connect with server. You double click on user you want to connect.
 - **Step 6:** When show chat dialog, begin chat between server and that user.

## Functions
- Chat together between server and client.
- Save all user connected to database.
- Save all message to database.
